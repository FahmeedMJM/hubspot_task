Description of the Code and Functionalities

This Python script uses the HubSpot API to fetch and display information about tickets and emails from a HubSpot account.
The script is structured to make HTTP GET requests to the HubSpot API, handle potential errors, parse the JSON responses, and display the relevant information in a readable format.

1.Importing the Modules
The requests module is used for making HTTP requests, and the json module is used for parsing JSON data.

2.Setting Headers
The headers include the authorization token required to authenticate with the HubSpot API.

3.Fetching Tickets
This function(fetch_tickets) makes a GET request to the HubSpot API to fetch ticket data. It handles HTTP errors and returns the raw JSON response as a string.

4. Fetching Emails
This function(fetch_email) makes a GET request to the HubSpot API to fetch email data. It similarly handles HTTP errors and returns the raw JSON response as a string.


5.Parsing and Displaying Tickets
This function(parse_and_display_tickets) parses the JSON string into a dictionary, iterates through the tickets, and prints their details.

6.Parsing and Displaying Emails
This function(parse_and_display_emails) parses the JSON string into a dictionary, iterates through the emails, and prints their details.

7.Executing the Functions:
This part of the script calls the functions to fetch tickets and emails, then parses and displays the results.
